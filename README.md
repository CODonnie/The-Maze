# The Maze game project

This project is a first-person 3D maze game, it replicates the concepts used in the famous 3d game "wolfenstein". It was made using SDL2(for creating the window), Raycasting(for creating the 3d illusion)and C programming language(for the game logic). The game runs on Linux/Ubuntu. The raycasting technique turns a 2D map into a 3D world.
.
The Maze was written  in C using `SDL2` library. Deveploment was performed using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4
